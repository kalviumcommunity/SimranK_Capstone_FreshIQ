# FreshIQ ‚Äì One App for Every Shelf ‚Äî Food, Meds, and More

### Idea:-

The primary idea is to build a smart, mobile-first platform that helps users manage groceries, medicines, and household items with ease.  
FreshIQ empowers users to track expiry dates, receive timely notifications, and discover AI-powered recipe suggestions based on what's in their pantry.  
Barcode scanning, real-time updates, and a seamless interface ensure that nothing goes to waste and every meal is inspired.

If there is enough time after implementing these features, I would optionally add:

- Smart home device integration (e.g., smart fridges for auto-inventory).
- Community recipe sharing and social features.
- Advanced analytics for waste reduction and spending.


### Features:-
- User Authentication ‚Äì Register, log in, and manage profiles (with Google OAuth).
- Dashboard for tracking inventory, expiry alerts, and recipe suggestions.
- Add items via barcode scanning or manual entry.
- Expiry date tracking with push notifications.
- AI-powered recipe recommendations based on available items.
- Smart shopping list generation.
- Upload images and documents for products.
- Real-time updates and notifications (WebSockets).
- Payment integration for premium features (Stripe).
- Admin dashboard for user and inventory management.


### Summary of the 30-Day Timeline

- List all essential features (barcode scanning, expiry tracking, recipe AI, notifications, admin dashboard, etc.).
- Identify user roles (User, Admin) and note any unique permissions each requires.
- Create a GitHub repository to store and version your code and install required files for Frontend and Backend.
- Low-Fidelity Wireframes.
- High-Fidelity Designs.
- Side-by-side code for Signup, Login, Dashboard, and Profile.


#### Week 2 (Days 8‚Äì14): Authentication, Database
- User Model and Product Model (with expiry, barcode, etc.).
- Use bcrypt for password hashing.
- JWT Setup.
- OAuth Setup (Google).
